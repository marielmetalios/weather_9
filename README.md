## Desription 
This is a weather application that retrieves data from OPen Weather (https://openweathermap.org/api) and provides the current weather and future conditions for that city. The app displays the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, a description of the weather for the icon's `alt` tag, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. 

Your search history will also be logged.
